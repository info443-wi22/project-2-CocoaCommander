# FirebaseUI React

## What is the software system, and what does it do?

Taken from the main repo:

*FirebaseUI React Components provides React Wrappers on top of the Firebase UI Web library and notably Firebase UI Auth.*

*FirebaseUI Auth provides a drop-in auth solution that handles the UI flows for signing in users with email addresses and passwords, and Identity Provider Sign In using Google, Facebook and others. It is built on top of Firebase Auth.*

In simpler terms, FirebaseUI helps allow componts to be created within a web-app. On the otherhand FIrebaseUI auth will also allow for users to be able to login into a web-app using their Google account, not having to create an entirely new account for a specific web-app.

## Who created the software, and who currently "maintains" it?

FirebaseUI React is an extension / addition to Firebase that was created by Google. As this is an open source codebase, anybody can contribute to it. With that being said, all submissions that are made, even those that are project members, require review. They use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
